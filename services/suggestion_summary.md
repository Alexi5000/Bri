# Follow-up Suggestion Generation - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 13 implements intelligent follow-up suggestion generation for BRI's conversational interface. The system analyzes user queries and responses to generate 1-3 relevant, contextual follow-up questions that help users explore video content more thoroughly.

## Requirements Addressed

- **Requirement 9.1**: Generate 1-3 relevant follow-up questions after each response
- **Requirement 9.2**: Suggest related aspects to explore based on query topic
- **Requirement 9.3**: Proactively offer to share additional relevant content
- **Requirement 9.4**: Enable users to select suggested questions for processing

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. Query Classification System

The `_classify_query_type()` method categorizes user queries into distinct types:

- **Visual Description**: Queries about what's visible in the video
- **Audio Transcript**: Queries about spoken content
- **Object Search**: Queries to find specific objects or people
- **Timestamp-Specific**: Queries about specific moments
- **Summary**: Queries requesting overviews or summaries
- **General**: Conversational queries

**Classification Logic**:
```python
def _classify_query_type(self, message_lower: str) -> str:
    # Prioritized pattern matching
    # 1. Summary queries (most specific)
    # 2. Audio/transcript queries
    # 3. Object search queries
    # 4. Timestamp-specific queries
    # 5. Visual description queries
    # 6. General conversational
```

#### 2. Template-Based Suggestion Generation

Each query type has dedicated suggestion templates:

**Visual Description Suggestions**:
- "Can you describe a specific moment in more detail?"
- "What are the people doing in the video?"
- "How does the scene change throughout the video?"

**Audio Transcript Suggestions**:
- "Can you summarize the main points discussed?"
- "What other topics are covered?"
- "What's the context around this conversation?"

**Object Search Suggestions**:
- "Are there any other similar moments?"
- "What's happening in those scenes?"
- "What else appears alongside it?"

**Timestamp-Specific Suggestions**:
- "What happens right before this moment?"
- "What happens right after this?"
- "Are there other important moments like this?"

**Summary Suggestions**:
- "Can you tell me more about a specific part?"
- "What are the key visual elements?"
- "What's the main message or theme?"

**General Suggestions**:
- "What's this video about?"
- "Can you describe what you see?"
- "What's being said in the audio?"

#### 3. Proactive Content Discovery

The `_detect_additional_content()` method analyzes responses for mentions of additional content:

**Detection Patterns**:
- "also", "additionally" → "Tell me more about what else you found"
- "other moments/scenes" → "Show me those other moments"
- "more", "several", "multiple" → "Can you elaborate on that?"
- "beginning/start" → "What happens later in the video?"
- "end/ending" → "What led up to that?"
- "Q&A" → "Want me to summarize the Q&A session?"
- "interview" → "What are the key points from the interview?"
- "demonstration" → "Can you walk me through the demonstration?"

#### 4. Suggestion Deduplication and Limiting

The system ensures:
- Suggestions are unique (no duplicates)
- Returns exactly 1-3 suggestions (requirement 9.1)
- Prioritizes diversity and relevance
- Maintains order of importance

### Integration with Agent

The suggestion generation is integrated into the main `chat()` method:

```python
async def chat(self, message: str, video_id: str, image_base64: Optional[str] = None):
    # ... process query and generate response ...
    
    # Generate follow-up suggestions
    suggestions = self._generate_suggestions(message, response_text, video_id)
    
    # Return response with suggestions
    return AssistantMessageResponse(
        message=response_text,
        frames=frames,
        timestamps=timestamps,
        suggestions=suggestions,  # 1-3 suggestions
        frame_contexts=frame_context_objects
    )
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage

The implementation includes comprehensive tests in `scripts/test_task_13_suggestions.py`:

1. **Query Classification Tests**: Verify correct categorization of 12 different query types
2. **Proactive Detection Tests**: Verify detection of additional content mentions
3. **Suggestion Generation Tests**: Verify 8 different scenarios including:
   - Visual description queries
   - Audio transcript queries
   - Object search queries
   - Timestamp-specific queries
   - Summary queries
   - General conversational queries
   - Proactive content detection scenarios

### Test Results

```
Total Tests: 8
Passed: 8
Failed: 0

Key Features Verified:
  ✓ Generates 1-3 relevant suggestions (Requirement 9.1)
  ✓ Adapts suggestions based on query type (Requirement 9.2)
  ✓ Proactively suggests content discovery (Requirement 9.3)
  ✓ Suggestions are actionable and relevant (Requirement 9.4)
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Visual Description Query

**User**: "What's happening in the video?"

**Response**: "The video shows a person walking through a park with trees and benches visible."

**Suggestions**:
1. "Can you describe a specific moment in more detail?"
2. "What are the people doing in the video?"
3. "How does the scene change throughout the video?"

### Example 2: Audio Transcript Query

**User**: "What did they say about the project?"

**Response**: "They mentioned that the project is progressing well and discussed the timeline."

**Suggestions**:
1. "Can you summarize the main points discussed?"
2. "What other topics are covered?"
3. "What's the context around this conversation?"

### Example 3: Proactive Content Discovery

**User**: "What's in this video?"

**Response**: "The video contains a presentation followed by a Q&A session with the audience."

**Suggestions**:
1. "What's this video about?"
2. "Can you describe what you see?"
3. "Want me to summarize the Q&A session?" ← Proactive suggestion

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Engagement**: Suggestions guide users to explore content more deeply
2. **Improved Discovery**: Proactive suggestions help users find content they might miss
3. **Natural Conversation Flow**: Context-aware suggestions feel like natural conversation
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users don't need to think of what to ask next
5. **Better User Experience**: Aligns with BRI's warm, supportive personality

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Personalization**: Learn user preferences and adapt suggestions
2. **Context History**: Consider previous conversation turns for better suggestions
3. **Video-Specific Suggestions**: Tailor suggestions based on video content type
4. **Dynamic Suggestion Count**: Vary between 1-3 based on context richness
5. **Suggestion Ranking**: Use ML to rank suggestions by predicted relevance

## Files Modified

- `services/agent.py`: Added suggestion generation methods
  - `_generate_suggestions()`: Main suggestion generation logic
  - `_classify_query_type()`: Query type classification
  - `_suggest_*_followups()`: Template methods for each query type
  - `_detect_additional_content()`: Proactive content detection

## Files Created

- `services/suggestion_summary.md`: This documentation

## Conclusion

Task 13 successfully implements intelligent follow-up suggestion generation that meets all requirements (9.1-9.4). The system provides contextual, relevant suggestions that enhance user engagement and content discovery while maintaining BRI's warm, supportive personality.
