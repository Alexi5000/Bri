# Requirements Document

## Introduction

BRI (Brianna) is an open-source, empathetic multimodal agent for video processing that enables users to upload videos and ask natural language questions to receive context-aware, conversational responses. The system is designed with a feminine, approachable UI/UX featuring warm colors and intuitive interactions, making video analysis feel like discussing content with a knowledgeable friend. BRI leverages open-source tools (OpenCV, Whisper, BLIP, YOLO) and Groq's LLM for intelligent video understanding, maintains conversational memory for seamless follow-ups, and prioritizes accessibility for users of all technical levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Warm and Approachable User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visually appealing and intuitive interface that feels welcoming and friendly, so that I feel comfortable interacting with the video analysis tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a soft color scheme with feminine touches (blush pink, lavender, or teal accents) and rounded edges
2. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide friendly microcopy (e.g., "Ready when you are! Upload a video to start.")
3. WHEN the system is processing a video THEN the system SHALL display visual feedback with supportive messages (e.g., "I'm analyzing your video—just a sec!")
4. WHEN the user receives responses THEN the system SHALL support emoji/reaction elements for a playful, engaging touch
5. WHEN the user navigates the interface THEN the system SHALL provide smooth micro-interactions that feel warm and responsive

### Requirement 2: Video Upload and Management

4. WHEN a video is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store the video locally and create a unique identifier for reference
5. WHEN the upload completes THEN the system SHALL display the video in a library view with thumbnail preview
6. IF the video upload fails THEN the system SHALL display a playful yet clear error message with suggested next steps

### Requirement 3: Video Processing and Context Extraction

6. WHEN processing is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators with friendly messages
7. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL notify the user with "All set! What would you like to know?"
8. IF processing fails for any component THEN the system SHALL continue with available data and log the failure gracefully

### Requirement 4: Natural Language Query Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask questions about my video in natural language, so that I can easily find specific information without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a text query THEN the system SHALL process the query using Groq API for natural language understanding
2. WHEN the user asks about content (e.g., "What's happening here?") THEN the system SHALL analyze captions and provide a descriptive response
3. WHEN the user asks about timestamps (e.g., "What did they say at 1:22?") THEN the system SHALL retrieve transcript data for the specified time and respond with the content
4. WHEN the user asks about objects/people (e.g., "Show me all the cats in this video") THEN the system SHALL search object detection results and return relevant frames with timestamps
5. WHEN the user asks a follow-up question THEN the system SHALL use conversation context to provide coherent responses
6. WHEN the system generates a response THEN the system SHALL use a supportive, clear, and engaging tone
7. IF the query cannot be answered with available data THEN the system SHALL provide a friendly explanation and suggest alternative queries

### Requirement 5: Conversational Memory and Context

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember our previous conversations about a video, so that I can ask follow-up questions naturally without repeating context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a query THEN the system SHALL store the query, response, and video context in the memory layer (SQLite)
2. WHEN the user asks a follow-up question THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant conversation history to maintain context
3. WHEN the system responds THEN the system SHALL reference previous interactions when relevant (e.g., "Earlier, you asked about the blue car—here's more detail!")
4. WHEN the user starts a new conversation about a different video THEN the system SHALL maintain separate memory contexts per video
5. WHEN the user requests THEN the system SHALL provide an optional "memory wipe" feature for privacy
6. WHEN retrieving memory THEN the system SHALL limit context to the most recent N interactions to maintain performance

### Requirement 6: MCP Server and Tool Discovery

**User Story:** As a developer/system, I want a standardized way to discover and integrate video processing tools, so that the system can dynamically use available capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts THEN the system SHALL expose available tools (captioning, object detection, audio transcription) via FastAPI endpoints
2. WHEN the agent needs to process video THEN the system SHALL query the MCP server for available tools
3. WHEN a tool is called THEN the system SHALL use a standardized interface for input/output
4. WHEN a tool fails THEN the system SHALL implement graceful fallbacks and log the error
5. WHEN new tools are added THEN the system SHALL automatically discover them without code changes to the agent
6. WHEN tools are processing THEN the system SHALL use Redis for caching intermediate results

### Requirement 7: Intelligent Tool Routing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically determine which processing tools to use based on my question, so that I get accurate answers efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
