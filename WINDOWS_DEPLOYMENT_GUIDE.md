# BRI Video Agent - Windows Local Deployment Guide

Complete guide to deploy and test BRI on Windows (with optional WSL support).

## üéØ Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites Check

1. **Python 3.11+** installed
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```
   If not installed, download from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. **Git** installed (you already have this)
   ```cmd
   git --version
   ```

3. **Groq API Key** (Required)
   - Get your free API key from: https://console.groq.com/keys
   - Keep it handy for the next step

### Step 1: Configure Environment

1. **Copy the environment template**:
   ```cmd
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Edit `.env` file** and add your Groq API key:
   ```cmd
   notepad .env
   ```
   
   Replace `your_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here
   ```
   
   Save and close the file.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all required packages (takes 2-3 minutes).

### Step 3: Start BRI

```cmd
scripts\start_dev.bat
```

This script will:
- ‚úÖ Create necessary directories
- ‚úÖ Initialize the database
- ‚úÖ Start the MCP server (port 8000)
- ‚úÖ Start the Streamlit UI (port 8501)

### Step 4: Access BRI

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: "GROQ_API_KEY not found"
**Solution**: 
1. Make sure you copied `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Edit `.env` and add your actual Groq API key
3. Restart the application

### Issue: "Port 8501 already in use"
**Solution**:
```cmd
# Find what's using the port
netstat -ano | findstr :8501

# Kill the process (replace PID with actual process ID)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Restart BRI
scripts\start_dev.bat
```

### Issue: "MCP Server failed to start"
**Solution**:
```cmd
# Check if port 8000 is available
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# If blocked, kill the process
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Restart BRI
scripts\start_dev.bat
```

### Issue: Video processing is slow
**Solution**:
- Use shorter videos (under 2 minutes) for testing
- Close other applications to free up CPU/memory
- Check that your video format is supported (MP4 works best)

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**:
```cmd
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution**:
```cmd
# Reinitialize database
python scripts\init_db.py

# Restart BRI
scripts\start_dev.bat
```
