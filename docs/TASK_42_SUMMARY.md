# Task 42: Enhanced Agent Intelligence & Context Retrieval - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive enhancements to the agent's intelligence and context retrieval capabilities, ensuring the agent can effectively use all available video data to provide rich, accurate responses.

## Completed Subtasks

### 42.1 Fix Agent Context Building ✅
**Objective**: Ensure agent checks database for ALL available data types and builds rich context even with partial data.

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `ContextBuilder.build_video_context()` to check database for ALL data types with proper prioritization
- Added comprehensive logging of data availability (captions, transcripts, objects, frames)
- Implemented `build_rich_context_description()` method to create human-readable context summaries
- Added fallback descriptions when higher-priority data is unavailable
- Priority order: captions > transcripts > objects > frames

**Key Changes**:
- `services/context.py`: Enhanced `build_video_context()` with comprehensive data retrieval
- Added `build_rich_context_description()` for rich text summaries
- Added `_format_timestamp()` helper for consistent timestamp formatting

### 42.2 Implement Smart Query Routing ✅
**Objective**: Route queries intelligently based on query type (visual, audio, temporal, object search, general).

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `ToolRouter.analyze_query()` with smart query classification
- Added `_classify_query_type()` method to determine query intent
- Implemented routing logic:
  - **Visual questions** → Use captions + objects
  - **Audio questions** → Use transcripts
  - **Temporal questions** → Use all data with timestamp filtering
  - **Object search** → Use objects + captions for context
  - **General questions** → Use comprehensive context

**Key Changes**:
- `services/router.py`: Added query type classification and smart routing
- Added logging for query type detection
- Enhanced tool selection based on query intent

### 42.3 Add Semantic Search for Better Retrieval ✅
**Objective**: Improve keyword matching with stemming/lemmatization and relevance scoring.

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `search_captions()` with multi-factor relevance scoring:
  - Exact phrase matching (100 points)
  - Stemmed word overlap (50 points)
  - Partial word matches (25 points)
  - Synonym/related word matching (10 points)
  - Confidence-based score boosting
- Enhanced `search_transcripts()` with similar relevance scoring
- Added `_tokenize_and_stem()` for basic stemming (suffix removal)
- Added `_calculate_synonym_score()` with common visual term synonyms

**Key Changes**:
- `services/context.py`: Enhanced search methods with relevance scoring
- Added stemming and synonym matching capabilities
- Implemented ranked results with top-k selection

### 42.4 Optimize Agent Prompts ✅
**Objective**: Reduce prompt size by summarizing long contexts and including only relevant data.

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `_build_tool_prompt()` with structured format: "Visual: ..., Audio: ..., Objects: ..."
- Implemented query-aware context filtering (include more data for relevant query types)
- Added timestamp-based context filtering (10-second window around specified timestamps)
- Implemented text truncation for very long captions/transcripts
- Added conversation context summarization (limit to 500 chars)
- Added prompt size logging for monitoring

**Key Changes**:
- `services/agent.py`: Enhanced prompt building with smart filtering and summarization
- Added timestamp-based context windowing
- Implemented text truncation to stay within token limits

## Enhanced Agent Capabilities

### 1. Database-First Context Retrieval
The agent now checks the database FIRST for all available data before calling MCP tools:
```python
# Check database for ALL available data types
video_context = self.context_builder.build_video_context(video_id)
# Extract captions, transcripts, objects, frames
# Only call MCP tools if no data in database
```

### 2. Smart Query Routing
Queries are classified and routed intelligently:
- Visual: "What do you see?" → captions + objects
- Audio: "What did they say?" → transcripts
- Temporal: "What happens at 1:30?" → all data with timestamp filtering
- Object: "Find all the dogs" → objects + captions
- General: "Summarize the video" → comprehensive context

### 3. Improved Search Quality
Search results are now ranked by relevance using multiple factors:
- Exact phrase matches get highest priority
- Stemmed word overlap for better matching (e.g., "walking" matches "walk")
- Partial word matches for fuzzy matching
- Synonym matching for related terms (e.g., "person" matches "man", "woman")
- Confidence-based score boosting

### 4. Optimized Prompts
Prompts are now more efficient and focused:
- Include only relevant data for the specific query type
- Filter context by timestamp when specified
- Truncate very long text to save tokens
- Summarize conversation history
- Log prompt size for monitoring

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
1. Test `build_video_context()` with various data availability scenarios
2. Test `_classify_query_type()` with different query patterns
3. Test `search_captions()` relevance scoring with known queries
4. Test prompt building with different query types and data sizes

### Integration Tests
1. Test end-to-end query processing with real video data
2. Test agent responses with partial data (only captions, only transcripts, etc.)
3. Test timestamp-based queries with context filtering
4. Test prompt size stays within reasonable limits

### Performance Tests
1. Measure query response time with database-first approach
2. Compare search quality before/after semantic enhancements
3. Monitor prompt token usage across different query types

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements
- **Faster responses**: Database-first approach avoids unnecessary MCP calls
- **Better accuracy**: Smart routing ensures relevant data is used
- **Higher relevance**: Improved search ranking returns better results
- **Lower costs**: Optimized prompts reduce token usage

### Metrics to Monitor
- Query response time (target: <3s for 80% of queries)
- Search result relevance (user feedback)
- Prompt token usage (target: <2000 tokens per query)
- Cache hit rate for database context

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run integration tests with real video data
2. Monitor agent response quality
3. Collect user feedback on search relevance

### Future Enhancements
1. Implement embedding-based semantic search (sentence-transformers)
2. Add vector database integration (Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB)
3. Implement query expansion for better recall
4. Add user feedback loop for relevance tuning

## Files Modified
- `services/context.py`: Enhanced context building and search
- `services/agent.py`: Enhanced prompt building and context gathering
- `services/router.py`: Added smart query routing

## Dependencies
- Requires Tasks 40-41 complete (data persistence and validation)
- No new external dependencies added
- Uses existing database schema and storage layer

## Success Criteria ✅
- [x] Agent checks database for ALL available data types
- [x] Smart query routing based on query type
- [x] Improved search with relevance scoring
- [x] Optimized prompts with context summarization
- [x] No syntax errors or diagnostics issues
- [x] All subtasks completed

## Conclusion
Task 42 successfully enhanced the agent's intelligence and context retrieval capabilities. The agent now:
1. Prioritizes existing database data over MCP tool calls
2. Routes queries intelligently based on intent
3. Returns more relevant search results with ranking
4. Uses optimized prompts that stay within token limits

These enhancements significantly improve the agent's ability to provide accurate, relevant, and timely responses to user queries about video content.
