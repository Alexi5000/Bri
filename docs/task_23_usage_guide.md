   - ‚úÖ "Show me when the cat appears"

4. **Ask About Audio**
   - ‚úÖ "What did they say about X?"
   - ‚úÖ "Summarize the conversation"
   - ‚úÖ "Find when they mention Y"

### Follow-up Questions

BRI maintains context, so you can ask follow-ups:

```
You: What's the main topic?
BRI: The video discusses climate change...

You: Tell me more about that
BRI: [Provides detailed information using context]

You: When do they mention solutions?
BRI: [Searches for relevant moments]
```

### Using Suggestions

Suggestions help you explore the video:

1. **Discovery**: Find content you didn't know about
2. **Deep Dive**: Get more details on topics
3. **Navigation**: Jump to related moments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Oops! Something went wrong"

**Cause**: API error or processing failure

**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Verify GROQ_API_KEY in .env
- Try asking the question differently
- Check logs for details

#### 2. No Frames Displayed

**Cause**: Video not processed or frames not extracted

**Solutions:**
- Wait for video processing to complete
- Check processing status in video library
- Re-upload video if needed

#### 3. Slow Responses

**Cause**: Complex query or large video

**Solutions:**
- Be patient during first query (no cache)
- Subsequent queries are faster (cached)
- Ask more specific questions
- Check MCP server is running

#### 4. Timestamps Don't Work

**Cause**: Video player not loaded or state issue

**Solutions:**
- Refresh the page
- Reselect the video
- Check video file exists

**Example 1: Tool Failure**
```
"I had trouble extracting frames, but I can still help with the audio!"
```
