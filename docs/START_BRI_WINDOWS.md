# üöÄ Start BRI on Windows - Quick Guide

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites (Already Done!)
- [x] Python 3.11+ installed
- [x] Dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- [x] `.env` file configured with GROQ_API_KEY
- [x] Database initialized

## üéØ Start BRI (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Start MCP Server

Open a **NEW** Command Prompt or PowerShell window and run:

```cmd
python -m uvicorn mcp_server.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

You should see:
```
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

**Keep this window open!** The MCP server needs to stay running.

### Step 2: Start Streamlit UI

Open **ANOTHER** Command Prompt or PowerShell window and run:

```cmd
streamlit run app.py
```

You should see:
```
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.x.x:8501
```

**Keep this window open too!**

### Step 3: Open BRI in Browser

Your browser should automatically open to:
```
http://localhost:8501
```

If not, manually open your browser and go to that URL.

üéâ **BRI is now running!**

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Address already in use" error

**For Port 8000 (MCP Server)**:
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

**For Port 8501 (Streamlit)**:
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :8501
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

Then restart the services.

### "Module not found" error

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
```

### MCP Server not responding

1. Check the MCP Server window for errors
2. Make sure you're in the project root directory
3. Verify `.env` file has GROQ_API_KEY set

### Streamlit shows connection error

1. Make sure MCP Server is running first (Step 1)
2. Wait 5-10 seconds for MCP Server to fully start
3. Then start Streamlit (Step 2)

## üìù Alternative: Use the Batch Script

If you prefer, you can use the automated script:

```cmd
scripts\start_dev.bat
```

This will start both services automatically, but you'll need to open separate windows to see the logs.
