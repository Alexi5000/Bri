# Task 21: Video Player with Timestamp Navigation

## Overview
Implemented a video player component with timestamp navigation capabilities, allowing users to jump to specific moments in videos from conversation context.

## Implementation Details

### Components Created

#### 1. Video Player Component (`ui/player.py`)
Main video player with full navigation capabilities:

**Key Functions:**
- `render_video_player()` - Main player rendering with controls
- `render_video_player_with_context()` - Player synced with conversation
- `navigate_to_timestamp()` - Programmatic timestamp navigation
- `get_current_playback_time()` - Get current playback position
- `extract_timestamps_from_conversation()` - Extract timestamps from chat

**Features:**
- Streamlit native video component integration
- Playback controls (start, back 10s, pause, forward 10s, reset)
- Clickable timestamp chips for quick navigation
- Session state management for playback position
- Automatic timestamp extraction from conversation
- Responsive design with BRI's color scheme

#### 2. Chat Integration
Updated `ui/chat.py` to support clickable timestamps:
- Frame thumbnails now have clickable timestamp buttons
- Clicking a timestamp navigates the video player
- Timestamps stored in session state for cross-component communication

#### 3. Main App Integration
Updated `app.py` to integrate player with chat:
- Two-column layout: video player (left) + chat (right)
- Automatic timestamp extraction from conversation history
- Synchronized playback with conversation context
- Seamless navigation between chat and player

### Features Implemented

#### Video Player
- ✅ Embedded video player using Streamlit's video component
- ✅ Start time support for initial positioning
- ✅ Playback controls (start, back, forward, reset)
- ✅ Visual feedback for current timestamp

#### Timestamp Navigation
- ✅ Clickable timestamp chips extracted from conversation
- ✅ Automatic timestamp detection in messages (MM:SS and HH:MM:SS formats)
- ✅ Jump to specific moments from chat responses
- ✅ Visual indication of active timestamp

#### Conversation Sync
- ✅ Extract timestamps from conversation history
- ✅ Display relevant moments from chat
- ✅ Cross-component communication via session state
- ✅ Maintain playback position across interactions

### Technical Implementation

#### Timestamp Format Support
The player recognizes multiple timestamp formats:
- `MM:SS` - Minutes and seconds (e.g., "1:23")
- `HH:MM:SS` - Hours, minutes, and seconds (e.g., "01:30:45")
- Extracted from both structured data and text content

#### Session State Management
```python
st.session_state[f"player_{video_id}"] = {
    "current_time": 0.0,
    "is_playing": False,
    "selected_timestamp": None
}
```

#### Timestamp Extraction
Uses regex pattern matching to find timestamps in conversation:
```python
pattern = r'\b(\d{1,2}):(\d{2})(?::(\d{2}))?\b'
```

### UI/UX Design

#### Visual Elements
- Rounded container with soft shadows
- Gradient timestamp chips (lavender to pink)
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Active state indication for current timestamp
- Responsive column layout

#### Color Scheme
- Background: White with soft gray accents
- Timestamp chips: Lavender (#E6E6FA) to Pink (#FFB6C1) gradient
- Active state: Teal (#40E0D0) gradient
- Consistent with BRI's feminine, approachable design

### Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`scripts/test_video_player.py`):
- ✅ Timestamp formatting (MM:SS and HH:MM:SS)
- ✅ Timestamp extraction from conversation
- ✅ Navigation functions
- ✅ Component structure validation
- ✅ Pattern recognition for various formats

All tests passed successfully.

## Requirements Satisfied

### Requirement 8.4
**"WHEN the user clicks on a timestamp THEN the system SHALL navigate to that point in the video"**

✅ Implemented:
- Clickable timestamps in chat responses
- Timestamp chips in player interface
- Programmatic navigation via `navigate_to_timestamp()`
- Visual feedback for navigation actions

## Usage Examples

### Basic Player Usage
```python
from ui.player import render_video_player

render_video_player(
    video_path="data/videos/video_123.mp4",
    video_id="video_123",
    current_timestamp=65.5,  # Start at 1:05
    timestamps=[30.0, 65.5, 120.0]  # Relevant moments
)
```

### With Conversation Context
```python
from ui.player import render_video_player_with_context

render_video_player_with_context(
    video_path="data/videos/video_123.mp4",
    video_id="video_123",
    conversation_timestamps=[30.0, 65.5, 120.0]
)
```

### Programmatic Navigation
```python
from ui.player import navigate_to_timestamp

# Jump to 2:15 in the video
navigate_to_timestamp("video_123", 135.0)
```

## Integration Points

### With Chat Component
- Chat displays clickable timestamps on frame thumbnails
- Clicking timestamp stores value in `st.session_state["clicked_timestamp"]`
- Player checks for clicked timestamp and navigates accordingly

### With Conversation History
- Automatically extracts timestamps from message content
- Displays all relevant moments as clickable chips
- Maintains sync between conversation and playback

### With Video Library
- Player receives video path from library selection
- Video ID used for session state management
- Seamless transition from library to chat with player

## Limitations & Notes

### Streamlit Video Component
- Streamlit's native video component has limited programmatic control
- `start_time` parameter only works on initial load
- Full seek control would require custom video player (future enhancement)
- Current implementation provides timestamp info and reloads video at position

### Browser Compatibility
- Video playback depends on browser codec support
- MP4 with H.264 codec recommended for best compatibility
- Some formats may not work in all browsers

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Video Player**
   - Full programmatic seek control
   - Real-time playback position tracking
   - Custom controls with BRI styling

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Playback speed control
   - Volume control
   - Fullscreen mode
   - Picture-in-picture support

3. **Timestamp Features**
   - Timestamp bookmarks
   - Timestamp annotations
   - Timestamp sharing
   - Timestamp history

4. **Accessibility**
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Screen reader support
   - Caption/subtitle display
   - High contrast mode

## Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `ui/player.py` - Video player component (new)
- `scripts/test_video_player.py` - Test suite (new)
- `docs/task_21_video_player.md` - This documentation (new)

### Modified
- `ui/chat.py` - Added clickable timestamps to frame displays
- `app.py` - Integrated player with chat interface

## Verification

Run the test suite:
```bash
python scripts/test_video_player.py
```

Expected output:
```
✓ Timestamp formatting tests passed
✓ Timestamp extraction tests passed
✓ Navigation function tests passed
✓ Player component structure tests passed
✓ Timestamp pattern recognition tests passed
✓ ALL TESTS PASSED
```

## Conclusion

Task 21 is complete. The video player with timestamp navigation is fully implemented and tested, satisfying Requirement 8.4. Users can now:
- Watch videos in the UI
- Click timestamps in chat to jump to specific moments
- Use playback controls for navigation
- See all relevant moments from conversation as clickable chips

The implementation maintains BRI's warm, approachable design while providing intuitive video navigation capabilities.
