- ✅ **Persistent storage**: SQLite backend (aligns with BRI's architecture)
- ✅ **Low operational overhead**: Can run embedded or as lightweight server
- ✅ **Active development**: Strong community, frequent updates

**Cons**:
- ⚠️ **Smaller scale**: Best for <10M vectors (sufficient for BRI's use case)
- ⚠️ **Limited distributed features**: Single-node focused

**Integration Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Very Easy)

**Cost**: $0 (open-source)

**Best For**: BRI's current scale, local-first architecture, rapid prototyping

**Sample Code**:
```python
import chromadb
client = chromadb.Client()
collection = client.create_collection("captions")
collection.add(
    embeddings=[[0.1, 0.2, ...], ...],
    documents=["caption text", ...],
    metadatas=[{"video_id": "vid_123", "timestamp": 10.5}, ...],
    ids=["cap_1", "cap_2", ...]
)
results = collection.query(
    query_embeddings=[[0.1, 0.2, ...]],
    n_results=5,
    where={"video_id": "vid_123"}
)
```

## Recommendation: ChromaDB

**Rationale**:

1. **Alignment with BRI's Architecture**:
   - Uses SQLite backend (same as BRI's current storage)
   - Can run embedded (no separate server needed)
   - Local-first approach matches BRI's privacy focus

2. **Zero Cost & Complexity**:
   - No licensing fees or cloud costs
   - Minimal operational overhead
   - Easy to get started and iterate

3. **Sufficient Scale**:
   - BRI's current use case: ~100-1000 captions per video
   - ChromaDB handles <10M vectors easily
   - Can migrate to Qdrant/Weaviate if scale demands

4. **Excellent Developer Experience**:
   - Native Python API
   - Great documentation
   - Active community

5. **Future-Proof**:
   - Can export embeddings and migrate to other DBs if needed
   - Standard embedding format (numpy arrays)
   - No vendor lock-in

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: ChromaDB Integration (Recommended)
1. Install ChromaDB: `pip install chromadb`
2. Create embedding service using sentence-transformers
3. Implement semantic search in ContextBuilder
4. Add hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
5. Benchmark search quality improvements

### Phase 2: Optimization
1. Batch embedding generation
2. Incremental updates (only new captions)
3. Query result caching
4. Index optimization

### Phase 3: Migration Path (If Needed)
- If scale exceeds 10M vectors → Migrate to Qdrant
- If need enterprise features → Consider Weaviate
- If prefer managed service → Evaluate Pinecone

## Testing with Sample Data

### Test Dataset
- 10 sample videos (5-10 min each)
- ~500 captions total
- 100 test queries

### Metrics to Track
- Query latency (target: <100ms)
- Search quality (precision@5, recall@5)
- Indexing time (target: <1s per video)
- Memory usage (target: <500MB)

### Success Criteria
- ✅ 90%+ search quality improvement over keyword search
- ✅ <100ms query latency
- ✅ <1s indexing time per video
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing codebase

## Conclusion

**ChromaDB is the recommended choice** for BRI's vector database needs due to its:
- Zero cost and complexity
- Perfect fit with BRI's local-first architecture
- Excellent Python SDK and documentation
- Sufficient scale for current and near-term needs

The implementation can be completed in ~4-6 hours with minimal risk and maximum flexibility for future changes.
