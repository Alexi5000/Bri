## Tips & Best Practices

- Conversations are automatically grouped by session
- Use the history to track what you've already asked

### 2. Continue Previous Discussions
- Load past conversations to maintain context
- BRI will remember what you discussed before
- Great for multi-part questions or follow-ups

### 3. Privacy Management
- Use memory wipe when you want to start fresh
- Clear history before sharing your screen
- Each video's history is independent

### 4. Navigation
- Recent conversations appear at the top
- Timestamps help you find specific discussions
- Expand multiple conversations to compare responses

## Example Workflow

### Scenario: Analyzing a Tutorial Video

1. **First Session** (Today, 2:00 PM)
   - You: "What topics are covered in this video?"
   - BRI: "This tutorial covers Python basics, functions, and loops."

2. **Second Session** (Today, 2:15 PM)
   - You: "Can you show me where they explain functions?"
   - BRI: "Functions are explained at 5:30 in the video."

3. **Later** (Today, 4:00 PM)
   - You return and want to continue
   - Load the second session from history
   - Continue: "What about loops?"
   - BRI remembers the context and responds accordingly

## Troubleshooting

### History Not Showing
