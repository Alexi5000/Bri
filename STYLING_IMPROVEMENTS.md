   ```

2. **Change accent colors** in `ui/styles.py`:
   ```python
   COLORS = {
       'accent_pink': '#FF69B4',  # Change this
       'teal': '#26C6DA',         # Or this
   }
   ```

3. **Modify message bubble colors** in `ui/chat.py`:
   ```css
   .user-message .message-content {
       background: linear-gradient(135deg, #26C6DA 0%, #00ACC1 100%);
   }
